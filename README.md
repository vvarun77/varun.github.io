Hey! I'm Varun Vijayababu, an Electrical and Computer Engineering + Mathematics major at the University of Washington. I'm interested in ML/AI and embedded systems,
along with applying mathematics to finance.

Some of my projects (as seen in the folders above) include modified Black-Scholes pricing bots, webscrapers for Stock related information, and a poker playing AI! If you
have any questions or would like to reach out please do so at varunv4@uw.edu :)

Thank you!
